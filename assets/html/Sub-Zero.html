        <h2>Sub-Zero</h2>
        <p>Sub-Zero is a fictional playable character from the Mortal Kombat series. He has appeared in every game in the series since debuting in 1992 in the first Mortal Kombat game. He has also appeared in other titles in the Mortal Kombat media franchise.<br><br>Kuai Liang and Bi-Han were the sons of a Chinese cryomancer and a simple American woman. It was known that the father (the fourth Sub-Zero in line) was a secret agent of the Lin Kuei clan in the United States. He soon married an American woman and had two sons. Against the will of the mother, the father takes his sons with him to China, where they become Lin Kuei warriors, leaving his wife and daughter in the United States. The older of Sub-Zero's two brothers, Bi-Han was introduced into the first Mortal Kombat game, where he competes in the Mortal Kombat tournament. He was ordered by the Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei clan to kill tournament master Shang Tsung and take his treasure, but he failed in his mission and was killed by the ghost of Scorpion, who sought to avenge his death. Bi-Han becomes an undead named Noob Saibot. In the direct sequel to Mortal Kombat II, Bi-Han's place is taken by his brother Kuai Liang. After his brother's death in the first tournament, Kuai Liang is sent by the Lin Kuei to complete an unfinished mission to kill Shang Tsung, whom he suspects of killing his older brother. In Mortal Kombat 3, a younger Sub-Zero is on the run from the Lin Kuei, who wanted to turn their warriors into cyborgs. The three cyborg assassins were programmed to find and destroy Sub-Zero, who had by this time received a vision from Raiden and agreed to join the rebellion against the new threat.In addition to the current Sub-Zero, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995) and Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996) include a non-canonical playable character known as "Classic Sub-Zero". His biography states that although he was believed to have died after the first Mortal Kombat tournament, he returned to assassinate Shang Tsung. However, his ending states that he is not Sub-Zero; rather he is an unidentified warrior who was missing from the previous tournament. In Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), Raiden once again summons Sub-Zero to assist in defending Earthrealm, this time against Shinnok. In the meantime, Sub-Zero fights Scorpion, who Quan Chi has tricked into believing the Lin Kuei warrior killed his family. In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), Sub-Zero defeats Sektor in a fight for leadership of the Lin Kuei. He also meets his apprentice Frost and takes her to fight alongside Earthrealm's warriors against the titular alliance of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. In Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), Sub-Zero joins the warrior Shujinko's group to defeat a new threat in the dragon king Onaga as well as confront Noob Saibot. In both Deadly Alliance and Mortal Kombat: Unchained (2006), Sub-Zero battles Frost for the Lin Kuei's leadership and emerges victorious. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks (2005), which serves as a retelling of Mortal Kombat II, Sub-Zero first appears as a boss character, but then allies with the protagonists Liu Kang and Kung Lao for a short time during the search for his older brother. He is last seen pursuing Saibot in the Netherrealm. Sub-Zero can also be unlocked as a playable character upon completing the game. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon's Konquest mode (2007), Sub-Zero faces the warrior Taven, though both eventually decide to ally to stop the invading Saibot and Smoke. After defeating them, Sub-Zero stays with the unconscious Saibot to find a way to save him. Sub-Zero appears as a playable character in the non-canonical crossover title Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (2009), which concerns a war between the eponymous fictional universes. In Sub-Zero's ending, he realizes he is no longer the assassin he once was and leaves the Lin Kuei. Inspired by Batman, he becomes a superhero. Unbeknownst to him, the Lin Kuei are hunting him for deserting them. Both incarnations of Sub-Zero appear in the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot game, with the younger assuming the mantle during standard gameplay. The reboot establishes the elder as Bi-Han and the latter as Kuai Liang, while also revealing that Liang used the codename "Tundra" before becoming Sub-Zero. While Bi-Han is still killed by Scorpion and becomes Noob Saibot, Liang's fate changes in the second tournament due to Raiden's interference in an attempt to avert Armageddon. After he defeats Scorpion, Sub-Zero is captured and turned into a cyborg instead of Smoke and forced to serve the otherworldly dimension Outworld and its tyrannical ruler, Shao Kahn. However, he is able to regain his mind and joins Raiden's warriors to stop Shao Kahn. His reunion with Bi-Han as Saibot comes much earlier than it did in the original timeline when he attempts to prevent Quan Chi's Soulnado from forming. After defeating his brother, Sub-Zero is relieved by Native American warrior Nightwolf. However, Shao Kahn's wife, Sindel, electrocutes Sub-Zero before Quan Chi "resurrects" and enslaves him in the Netherrealm as an undead revenant. Sub-Zero's background is further clarified during this installment as well, as it is revealed that the two brothers were in fact abducted by the Lin Kuei as infants after the clan murdered their parents.</p>
