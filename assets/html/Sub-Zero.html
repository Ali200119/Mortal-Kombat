        <h2>Sub-Zero</h2>
        <p>Sub-Zero is a fictional playable character from the Mortal Kombat series. He has appeared in every game in the series since debuting in 1992 in the first Mortal Kombat game. He has also appeared in other titles in the Mortal Kombat media franchise.<br><br>Kuai Liang and Bi-Han were the sons of a Chinese cryomancer and a simple American woman. It was known that the father (the fourth Sub-Zero in line) was a secret agent of the Lin Kuei clan in the United States. He soon married an American woman and had two sons. Against the will of the mother, the father takes his sons with him to China, where they become Lin Kuei warriors, leaving his wife and daughter in the United States. The older of Sub-Zero's two brothers, Bi-Han was introduced into the first Mortal Kombat game, where he competes in the Mortal Kombat tournament. He was ordered by the Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei clan to kill tournament master Shang Zong and take his treasure, but he failed in his mission and was killed by the ghost of Scorpion, who sought to avenge his death. Bi-Han becomes an undead named Noob Saibot. In the direct sequel to Mortal Kombat II, Bi-Han's place is taken by his brother Kuai Liang. After his brother's death in the first tournament, Kuai Liang is sent by the Lin Kuei to complete an unfinished mission to kill Shang Zong, whom he suspects of killing his older brother. In Mortal Kombat 3, a younger Sub-Zero is on the run from the Lin Kuei, who wanted to turn their warriors into cyborgs. The three cyborg assassins were programmed to find and destroy Sub-Zero, who had by this time received a vision from Raiden and agreed to join the rebellion against the new threat.</p>
