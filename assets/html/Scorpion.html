        <h2>Scorpion</h2>
        <p>Scorpion is a fictional character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. An undead ninja, he is principally defined by his quest to avenge the deaths of himself, his family, and his clan. His primary weapon is a kunai spear, which he uses to harpoon opponents.<br><br>Scorpion has received critical acclaim since his debut and frequently appears in media outside of the games. He is regarded as Mortal Kombat's most iconic fighter; series co-creator Ed Boon cites Scorpion as his favorite character.<br><br>In Mortal Kombat (1992), it is established that a series of Mortal Kombat tournaments are being held to determine if the forces of Outworld will be permitted by the Elder Gods to invade and conquer the dimension of Earthrealm. The game takes place during the tenth and final tournament, hosted by the shape-shifter sorcerer Shang Tsung, who is a servant of the Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. In the original game, it is implied Scorpion has enmity towards Sub-Zero due to rivalry between their opposing warrior clans (Scorpion's Japanese clan is unnamed, while the game names Sub-Zero's Chinese clan "Lin Kuei"). Scorpion's ending reveals he is actually an undead specter, a warrior who was killed by Sub-Zero, survived by a wife and child, and allowed to return to the physical realms in order to have his revenge. The same ending implies that the curse of Scorpion's supernatural existence means he can have revenge but cannot reunite with his still-living family. Canonically, after the tenth tournament is won by the human champion Liu Kang, Scorpion kills Sub-Zero. After the release of the first Mortal Kombat game, players were able to order a special tie-in comic book written and illustrated by MK co-creator John Tobias, published by Midway. The comic explained more of the backstory of the tournament and its characters, though it does not fully fit into the canon of later games in the franchise. In a one-page scene, two years after his death, Scorpion attacks Sub-Zero, who recognizes him and is shocked. Scorpion declares "demons" have allowed him to return and avenge his own demise. Wishing to gain his vengeance through an honorable fight rather than a surprise attack, Scorpion leaves, promising Sub-Zero they will meet again in the tournament. Later games make it unclear how much time passes between Scorpion's death and the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament. The game Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) shows Sub-Zero joining Mortal Kombat days or weeks after he kills Scorpion, but does not clarify whether he is joining the tenth tournament or one of the tournaments that occurred years earlier, surviving and later deciding to return for the tenth. In Mortal Kombat II (1993), some time after the tenth tournament, a rematch Mortal Kombat tournament held in the dimension of Outworld, now hosted by Emperor Shao Kahn. Another Lin Kuei warrior with ice abilities called Sub-Zero joins this tournament, with the game's introduction leaving it deliberately vague whether this is a new fighter or the original warrior back from the dead. Scorpion enters the new tournament to investigate this warrior. When Scorpion sees the new Sub-Zero spare the life of an opponent, he realizes this is not the cruel, cold-hearted man who killed him but the man's younger brother. Scorpion decides to be the younger Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother. The elder Sub-Zero and younger Sub-Zero are later given the birth names of Bi-Han and Kuai Liang, respectively, in the Mortal Kombat reboot game. Mortal Kombat II also introduces the characters Noob Saibot, an undead warrior who will later be revealed to be the resurrected Bi-Han.</p>
